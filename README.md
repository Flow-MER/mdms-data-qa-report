## Project Title: MDMS Data Quality Assurance (QA) Report Generator

## Summary

This repo provides a Python-based tool to generate data quality assurance (QA) reports from data exported from the Flow-MER Monitoring Data Management System (MDMS).

The reports consist of statistical summaries and graphical plots designed to be sent back to data suppliers. The primary goal is to help suppliers visually inspect and validate their data, ensuring it is a complete and accurate representation of their field collections before it is finalised and published.

## Data Quality Assurance Principles

### What is Quality Control?

Quality control is provided by activities that focus on identifying and managing data issues including **missing data**, **errors** and data that **do not conform to agreed data standards**. The QA reports generated by this tool are a critical part of the quality control process.

### The Role of the MDMS

Flow-MER Area-scale projects supply their monitoring data to the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder's Monitoring Data Management System (MDMS). The MDMS is a central, secure database that provides several key services:

- **Secure Storage**: Securely stores monitoring data collected by previous and current Flow-MER projects.
- **Primary Validation**: Acts as a central gateway to receive data uploads and provides primary enforcement of data standards. It automatically detects, rejects, and reports non-conforming data, allowing suppliers to correct issues and resubmit.
- **Data Aggregation**: Aggregates data across all Area-scale projects and through time.

### The Role of this QA Report Tool

This tool performs the crucial second step in the quality control process. While the MDMS is excellent at enforcing structural data standards, this tool helps identify more subtle issues.

1. Monitoring data that are successfully uploaded to the MDMS are exported.
2. This tool ingests those exports and creates statistical data summaries and graphic plots.
3. The reports are provided back to the data supplier to confirm that the data received match the expected data supply.

This quality review has proven to be a critically important step for the early detection of data issues, particularly **missing data** and the identification of **outliers**. Data suppliers are responsible for reviewing these reports and confirming that the data are complete and accurate before they are declared ‘final’ and published.

## Project Data

### Inputs
A single Microsoft Excel workbook (`.xlsx`) data export from the MDMS. This workbook may contain data for one or more monitoring themes (e.g., Fish, Waterbirds, Vegetation) across one or more groups.

### Output Data
A PDF and/or Markdown report is generated for each monitoring group found within the input workbook. These reports are saved in the `Outputs` directory.



## Prerequisites and Notes
The script is configured via dataclasses found in the `configs` directory. Each monitoring theme data standard (e.g., `fish_config.py`) has its own configuration file that defines the expected workbook structure, table joins, summary statistics, and plots.


## Processing Environment
Python.  Requirements (key libraries)

## Disclaimer
This code was built to do a specific job to help QA Flow-MER monitoring data from the Monitoring Data Management System (MDMS), not for production work using other data.
The code may be usable but also may contain `grotty hacks` that there was not time to polish out.
